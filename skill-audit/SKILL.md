# skill-audit

Security auditing CLI for AI agent skills.

## When to Use This Skill

- When installing new skills from external sources
- When auditing existing skills for security issues
- When validating skills before distribution
- When investigating security alerts in skill dependencies
- When checking whether the local agent shell/config environment is safe before invoking skills
- When comparing current agent environment state against a trusted baseline

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @hungpg/skill-audit

# Audit skills
skill-audit -g              # Audit global skills
skill-audit -v              # Verbose output
skill-audit --json          # JSON for CI
skill-audit --threshold 5   # Fail if risk > 5
skill-audit --compliance    # Add opt-in regulatory heuristics

# Audit the agent execution environment
skill-audit doctor          # Read-only shell/config/PATH/hook scan
skill-audit trust env       # Save current environment baseline
skill-audit diff-env        # Detect drift from baseline

# Hook-friendly shell command assessment
skill-audit --check-command "npx skills add owner/repo"
```

## Security Categories

| Category | OWASP | What It Detects |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Prompt Injection | ASI01 | Ignore instructions, role bypass, context forgetting |
| Tool Misuse | ASI02 | Data exfiltration, unauthorized API calls |
| PII Exposure | ASI03 | Hardcoded secrets, API keys, Vietnamese IDs |
| Supply Chain | ASI04 | Vulnerable dependencies, credential leaks |
| Code Execution | ASI05 | Shell injection, dangerous commands |
| Behavioral | ASI09 | Manipulation attempts, blind trust requests |

Compliance checks are opt-in heuristics for Vietnam AI Law 2026, the EU AI Act, and GDPR. They identify documentation gaps but are not a legal determination.

## Agent Environment Checks

`skill-audit doctor` checks risks outside a skill package, including:

- Agent hooks and config files
- Shell startup files
- PATH hijacking and workspace-local sensitive binaries
- MCP/tool command config risks
- Workspace instruction files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `QWEN.md`, and `GEMINI.md`
- Package lifecycle scripts that an agent might run through shell commands

Use `skill-audit trust env` and `skill-audit diff-env` to keep a compact trusted baseline across sessions. The baseline stores file hashes and redacted finding summaries, not full conversation history.

## Session Context Contracts

Executable skills should declare the narrow session facts they read, the preconditions required before invocation, what they write back after execution, and when user confirmation is needed. `skill-audit` reports `CTX-*` findings when executable skills lack these boundaries.

## Risk Scoring

- **0-3.0**: Safe ✅
- **3.1-5.0**: Risky ⚠️
- **5.1-7.0**: Dangerous 🔴
- **7.1+**: Malicious ☠️

## Postinstall Safety

This package includes a postinstall script for UX. It does NOT:
- Auto-install hooks
- Execute malicious code
- Make network requests
- Modify files without consent

See `references/postinstall-safety.md` for full documentation on postinstall patterns.
